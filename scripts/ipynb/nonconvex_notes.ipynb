# Nonconvex Optimization & Practical Notes

1. Nonconvexity: stationary points only; global optimum not guaranteed  
2. Ansatz expressivity: true ground-state must lie within manifold  
3. Smoothness & coercivity: avoid zeros in |ψ_θ|²; use regularized cumulants  
4. Constraint qualification: LICQ/MFCQ required for multipliers  
5. Discretization: finite differences introduce error  
6. Cryptographic/TEE assumptions: side-channel risks  
7. Validator risk: correlation may break independence assumption

Empirical runs (harmonic oscillator, hydrogen) confirm small-scale applicability
