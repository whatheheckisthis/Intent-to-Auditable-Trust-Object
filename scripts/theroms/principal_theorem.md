# Principal Theorem — Lawful Stationary Solution

**Theorem:** Assume A1–A6 (C¹ functions, coercive J, L-smoothness, K closed, LICQ, cryptographic audit). Then:

1. PGD iterates are bounded; accumulation points x* satisfy KKT conditions.  
2. Variational bound: ⟨ψ_{x*} | H | ψ_{x*}⟩ ≥ E₀  
3. Auditable solution: π(x*, t*) provides tamper-evident proof

Decision variable x ∈ ℝⁿ, objective f, constraints g,h, entropy H, cumulant penalty Φ, kernel K, entropy weight τ.
