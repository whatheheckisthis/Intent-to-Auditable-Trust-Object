# Batch 1 · Task 05 (Global #005)

## Batch Theme
DepVar/DepSet/DepCtx lattice foundations

## Objective
Implement and validate this TS/SCI non-interference micro-task as a standalone, testable increment.

## Source Prompt
> Define DepCtx alias + ctxInsert/ctxMember over same ⊆/∪ structure.

## Full-Fledged Deliverable Expectations
- Provide production-quality code (types, docstrings/comments, edge-case handling).
- Add or update tests demonstrating expected laws/properties.
- Document design choices and any assumptions.
- Keep interfaces composable for later theorem/bridge integration.

## Acceptance Checklist
- [ ] Feature implementation complete.
- [ ] Positive/negative test coverage added.
- [ ] Algebraic/logical properties stated and checked.
- [ ] API surface documented.
- [ ] Compatible with downstream TS/SCI phases.

## Suggested Validation Commands
```bash
pytest -q
```

```bash
python -m unittest
```
