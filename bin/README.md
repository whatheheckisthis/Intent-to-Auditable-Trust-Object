# `bin/` directory purpose

This folder stores legacy, archival, or one-off helper files.

## Layout

- `bin/scripts/` — legacy shell and Python helpers preserved for manual use.
- `bin/docs/` — archived notes, process docs, and plain-text references.
- `bin/web-assets/` — static HTML/CSS dependency visualization assets.

## Important

- Content in `bin/` is **not** the canonical source for active project workflows.
- Prefer `scripts/cli/architecture/`, `scripts/tools/`, `scripts/`, and `docs/` for maintained automation and documentation.
- Keep files here only when needed for history or manual reference.
