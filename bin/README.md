# `bin/` directory purpose

This folder stores legacy, archival, or one-off helper files.

## Important

- Content in `bin/` is **not** the canonical source for active project workflows.
- Prefer `ci/tools/`, `scripts/`, `config/`, and `docs/` for maintained automation and documentation.
- Keep files here only when needed for history or manual reference.
